# Landships-Demo
Setup:
Designate one player as the driver; they will be the host computer. The other player will be the gunner, who will be a client. After starting the game, each player can position their chair in the Vive play space so that they line up with the chair in the tank. Each player must be running the build on their own computer and Vive headset, though both players can be in the same play space using just one set of light houses. 

Starting the Game:
Multiplayer works through a LAN connection, so both computers must be on the same WIFI network.
1. Host presses "Create Game"
2. Client presses "Join Game"
3. Client types in the IP address displayed on the create screen of the host computer
4. After the client clicks "Join Game" they should show up in the lobby on the host computer
5. Host computer clicks "Start Game"
To start a single player game just skip steps 2-4, although the player can only drive the tank and will not be able to control the turret. 

Controlling Tank:
Interact with objects by intersecting it with the Vive controller and pressing and holding trigger with the index finger. 

As driver:
Use the two levers to control movement of tank. Each level corresponds to either the right tread or left tread. To move forward, move both levers forward. To do a gentle turn right turn, move the left lever forward, or vice versa. To do a sharp right turn, move the left lever forward and the right lever back, or vice versa. The driver can use the periscope to see outside, or can reach up to open the hatch and stand up to see out of the tank. 

As gunner:
Turn the horizontal crank to move the turret to the left and right, and the vertical crank to move the turret up and down. Press trigger on the red button to fire the tank. Use the periscope to see outside and communicate with the driver to know how to adjust aiming. 

Goal:
Players can drive around the area and destroy enemy tanks (tanks will explode and start smoking when hit by a shot). There are a total of four tanks in the map, though the game continues even after destroying all four. 

Troubleshooting:
There's currently no auto-reconnecting if a connection is dropped, so running multiplayer with an unstable connection requires restarting the build if it cuts out. If the client doesn't show up in the lobby of the host computer after entering the IP address, check that both computers are on the same WIFI network and that the IP address is correct. If it still doesn't show up, switching which computer is host, restarting the build, or making sure the .exe is allowed through the firewall may help.
